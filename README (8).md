# **BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION**




## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting breast cancer using X-ray images. The approach leverages machine learning techniques and image augmentation to enhance model performance. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with visualizations to interpret and validate results.


## 2. Dataset

### Description
The dataset consists of X-ray images of breast tissues and a CSV file with associated metadata. The images are divided into different folders representing various classes such as benign and malignant tumors. The CSV file contains features extracted from mammograms used to train machine learning models.
## 3. Data Preprocessing

### Process
Data preprocessing involves extracting and preparing the data for model training. This includes:

Image Preparation: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting X-ray images to improve model generalization.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features from the CSV file and handling missing values.
Normalization: Scaling feature values to a standard range for better model performance.
## 4. Image Augmentation

### Technique
Image augmentation is used to artificially expand the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, translation, shearing, and zooming. This helps in making the model more robust by providing diverse examples during training. Augmented images are visualized alongside the original images to understand the impact of these transformations.
## 5. Model Development

### Approach
Machine learning models are developed to classify X-ray images into different categories (e.g., malignant or benign). Several algorithms are tested, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost
Naive Bayes
Neural Network
Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## 6. Model Training

### Details
The models are trained using a training dataset split from the original dataset. For deep learning models, the training process includes setting up the architecture, compiling the model, and fitting it to the data. Training and validation metrics such as accuracy and loss are plotted to monitor the model's performance.
## 7. Model Evaluation

### Metrics
Model evaluation involves:

Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the performance of the classification model by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Providing detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
## 8. Visualization

### Glraphs
Several graphs are created to interpret the model and data:

Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss: Plots showing how the model's performance evolves over epochs.
Histograms: Displaying pixel value distributions in images.
Heatmaps: Representing differences between original and augmented images.
## 9. Results

### Summary
This section summarizes the results obtained from different models, including:

Best Performing Model: Based on evaluation metrics, the model with the highest performance is identified.
Comparison: A comparison of various models and their effectiveness in classifying breast cancer.
## 10. Conclusion

### Summary
The project demonstrates the use of machine learning and image processing techniques to develop a breast cancer detection system. By leveraging data augmentation and various classification algorithms, the system aims to provide accurate predictions and valuable insights into breast cancer diagnosis. Future work may involve refining models, expanding the dataset, and integrating additional features for enhanced performance.
